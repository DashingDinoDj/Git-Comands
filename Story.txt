Once apon a time there was a little girl named Anna. 
She walked around looking for a new toy car. 
She was just born and dint know what and where to go. 
This gave her the cofidence she needed to ask for help.
So she cried to her parents and got what she wanted. 
She is now happy with this new car.
But still is very bored.
